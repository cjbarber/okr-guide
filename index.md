## Resources and Tips for Implementing OKRs

OKRs: Objectives and Key Results

### Basics

[https://www.gv.com/lib/how-google-sets-goals-objectives-and-key-results-okrs](https://www.gv.com/lib/how-google-sets-goals-objectives-and-key-results-okrs)

  * Required watching. Great Google Ventures video on OKRs, including Doerr's original deck

  > Objectives are **ambitious**, and should feel somewhat uncomfortable  
  > Key Results are **measurable**; they should be easy to grade with a number (at Google we use a 0 – 1.0 scale to grade each key result at the end of a quarter)  
  > OKRs are **public**; everyone in the company should be able to see what everyone else is working on (and how they did in the past)  
  > **The “sweet spot” for an OKR grade is .6 – .7;** if someone consistently gets 1.0, their OKRs aren’t ambitious enough. **Low grades shouldn’t be punished;** see them as data to help refine the next quarter’s OKRs.  
  > **OKRs are not synonymous with employee evaluations.**

  * Different viewpoint to the Upstart article (near the bottom of this page), where Objectives can be projects

  * Great example of issues a company that implemented OKRs ran into

  * Every member of the company must have conviction in implementing OKRs
  * "Once the company commits to implementing the OKR system, an OKR shepherd should be identified; someone who can help educate the team, track and grade progress, and make the necessary tweaks to the implementation" (e.g. COO, engineering lead, etc)
  * Make OKRs part of your DNA - but also adapt them to suit your culture
  * Don't tie OKRs to bonuses, or performance reviews

  * Must read 3 part blog post about how Pusher implemented OKRs at their company

### Customizing OKRs

[http://blog.upstart.com/okrs-and-projects-how-we-set-goals-at-upstart/](http://blog.upstart.com/okrs-and-projects-how-we-set-goals-at-upstart/)

  * They wanted to track OKRs and projects separately, so now:
  * "Objectives are our top 3-5 general focus areas as a company and tend to be fairly consistent quarter to quarter"
  * For each key result, they list out projects the company is working on that are related
    * Each project has a clear outcome, and a clear owner

[http://hunterwalk.com/2013/03/01/manager-okrs-maker-okrs-how-id-change-googles-goal-setting-process/](http://hunterwalk.com/2013/03/01/manager-okrs-maker-okrs-how-id-change-googles-goal-setting-process/)

  * Instead, use:
    * "What are we building this month"
    * "N+12 Months - What will our product and business look like a year from now?"
    * Coupled with "Minimal Quarterly/Annual KPIs" - make sure to reality check and ask "do these quarterly targets get achieved given what we’re building?"

### Zynga's Take on OKRs

Mark Pincus from Zynga was also shown OKRs by Doerr. Read the following for Zynga's take.

  * Asana used to make full "episode" summaries public. This is the last episode summary that Asana made public, and has real examples of key results from Asana.
